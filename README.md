# Spin up CKAN docker-compose.yml
## Base mode

Use this if you are a maintainer and will not be making code changes to CKAN or to CKAN extensions

Copy the included `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`. Modify it depending on your own needs.

> [!WARNING]
> There is a sysadmin user created by default with the values defined in `CKAN_SYSADMIN_NAME` and `CKAN_SYSADMIN_PASSWORD` (`ckan_admin` and `test1234` by default). These must be changed before running this setup as a public CKAN instance.

To build the images:

```bash
	docker compose build
```

To start the containers:

```bash
	docker compose up
```

This will start up the containers in the current window. By default the containers will log direct to this window with each container
using a different colour. You could also use the -d "detach mode" option ie: `docker compose up -d` if you wished to use the current
window for something else.

At the end of the container start sequence there should be 6 containers running:

```bash
$ docker compose ps

```

After this step, CKAN should be running at `CKAN_SITE_URL` (by default https://localhost:8443) at the port of nginx

# Create custom Dockerfile with DCAT extension and Harvester (based on examples in ckan/Dockerfile.dev)
This repo provides a custom Dockerfile with DCAT extension and Harvester.

# Test harvesting the metadata from the CReDO Blazegraph repo
# Document differences between our current use of DCAT/DCTerms predicates and CKAN/DCAT-AP's use
# Try adding the CKAN, datapusher and solr services to the stack
# Intergrate the new services with the existing services (postgres, dragonfly (redis))
# Added code to data uploader to perform harvesting when data uploaded
